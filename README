This repository is used for the documentation of the Integrated-research-project (IRP) at UAS Darmstadt. The developed system is called Modular Measurement System (MMS).
Target of the IRP was creating a measurement environment for the multipurpose usage with different test benches.  Measurements of different temperatures, pressures, 
rotation-speeds and accelerations are the main target for MMS.
